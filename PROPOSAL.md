Delta Sigma Pi – Gamma Upsilon Chapter Website

Babson College

## My Project Proposal

**What I'm building:** (one sentence)

A website for Delta Sigma Pi (DSP) Gamma Upsilon Chapter (Professional Business Fraternity).

**Who it's for / Why I chose this:** (personal motivation or real user need)

This is for the members of the Gamma Upsilon Chapter (Group) of Delta Sigma Pi, as well as future potential new members (PNM) who decide they want to rush and want more information on DSP. I chose this because I am an active member in the fraternity who was asked multiple times throughout rush from a PNMs on where they could find more information about our specific chapter and was not able to point them to anything.

**Core features:** (3-5 bullet points of what it will do)

- Outline About us page letting people know what we stand for, our history, and other basic information abour our chapter.
- Havina a designated Brothers page where it outlines everyone on Ecomm, active brothers, and inactive brothers with relevant information and photos so PNMs know who they want to potentially talk to during rush events.
- Home page that talks about our guiding pillars and having picutres of the brotherhood to make us seem more approachable and give a brief introduction to our chapter.
- Inform PNMs about the recruitment process (rush) and what to expect so they can mentally prepare themselves without going in blind.

**What I don't know yet:** (honest list of things you'll need to figure out)

- How I will get all of the relevant information for the Brothers page and if I can get them in time.
- What are the relevant information for the about us page that brothers want to see on the website.
- What the layout of the website will look like.
